# Collaborative-Drawing
> An app where multiple people can draw together

This app uses websockets, node, mongoose, and the HTML5 canvas tag. Users can draw on the same canvas in real time, select different drawing colors and brush sizes, and reset the canvas. New users who join during a drawing are able to see the drawing in progress.
